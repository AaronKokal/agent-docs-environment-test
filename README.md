## üìö Documentation Framework Repository

This repository defines our **standardized documentation workflow** for all future projects. It serves as an example and a template for how documentation should be structured, maintained, and how AI agents can interact with it.

---

## üöÄ Purpose of This Repository

The goal of *this specific repository* is to demonstrate:

* A **docs framework** that defines the required documentation files every project must maintain.
* An **Agent README** (`framework/AGENT_README.md`) with instructions for AI assistants to manage and extend project documentation.
* A **DOCUMENT EDITING GUIDE** (`framework/DOCUMENT_EDITING_GUIDE.md`) with setup and maintenance rules for contributors working in their respective IDE.
* A **MIGRATION GUIDE** (`framework/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`) with instructions for an AI agent to migrate an existing project's documentation to this standardized framework.
* How to apply this framework to a project, using *this repository itself* as an example (`docs/` content).

By demonstrating this framework, documentation becomes **uniform, reliable, and easy to maintain** across all projects.

---

## üìñ Project Documentation (`docs/`)

The `docs/` folder contains the "living documents" for *this specific framework repository*. These files accumulate content over time and demonstrate how the framework is applied in practice.

* `project_mission.md` ‚Üí explains the **why** of this repository (its goals, pain points it addresses, and expected outcomes).
* `project_stack.md` ‚Üí lists **tooling and architecture** decisions made for *this repository's framework*.
* `project_structure.md` ‚Üí shows the repo‚Äôs tree structure with short explanations for each directory, specifically for *this repository*.
* `project_logs.md` ‚Üí project diary with milestones, decisions, and reasoning for *this repository's development*.
* `project_tasks.md` ‚Üí lists and categorizes all pending and future work tasks for *this repository*.
* `project_considerations.md` ‚Üí captures future ideas, alternatives, and deferred decisions for *this repository's framework*.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Framework Templates (`framework/`)

Fixed, foundational files used at the start of all future projects are located in the `framework/` folder. These are templates intended to be copied into a new project.

* `AGENT_README.md` ‚Üí detailed explanation for AI agent workflow and rules.
* `DOCUMENT_EDITING_GUIDE.md` ‚Üí explains environment setup, extensions, and maintenance rules for Markdown editing.
* `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` ‚Üí provides instructions for an AI agent to migrate an existing project's documentation to this standardized framework.
* `PROJECT_README.md` ‚Üí Template for new project READMEs.

## ü§ñ Agent Workflow for This Repository

As an AI agent working on *this repository*, see [`framework/AGENT_README.md`](./framework/AGENT_README.md) for your specific responsibilities regarding the `docs/` files.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Editing Environment for This Repository

Human contributors working on *this repository* should see [`framework/DOCUMENT_EDITING_GUIDE.md`](./framework/DOCUMENT_EDITING_GUIDE.md) for setting up VS Code with the required extensions and rules for working on Markdown docs.

## üöÄ How to Use This Framework (General Guidance)

To set up a new project using this documentation framework, follow these general steps:

1. **Integrate the Framework:**
    * Copy the entire `framework/` directory into your new project's root. This directory contains the `AGENT_README.md` (for AI agents), `DOCUMENT_EDITING_GUIDE.md` (for human contributors), `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` (for agents to migrate older projects), and `PROJECT_README.md` (template for a new project's README).
    * **Pro-tip:** Consider adding `framework/` to your `.gitignore` if these are purely templates and you don't want them tracked in your new project's main repository, or if you plan to manage them as a submodule or external dependency.

2. **Initialize Project Documentation:**
    * Create a `docs/` directory in your new project's root (if it doesn't already exist).
    * Fill the `docs/` directory with the required project-specific documentation files: `project_mission.md`, `project_stack.md`, `project_structure.md`, `project_logs.md`, `project_tasks.md`, and `project_considerations.md`. You can start with empty files or use templates you define (e.g., from an initial project setup script).

3. **Set up Your Project's `README.md`:**
    * Copy `framework/PROJECT_README.md` to the root of your new project and rename it to `README.md`.
    * Open your new `README.md` and fill in the bracketed placeholders (`[YOUR PROJECT TITLE HERE]`, etc.) with your project's specific details.

4. **Adhere to Standards:**
    * Ensure your team and any contributing AI agents refer to `framework/DOCUMENT_EDITING_GUIDE.md` for consistent Markdown formatting and style.

This process ensures your new project benefits from a standardized, consistent, and maintainable documentation structure from the start.
