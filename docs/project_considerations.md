## Project Considerations

This document records future ideas, alternatives considered, and deferred decisions for this **Documentation Framework Repository**. These are not yet tasks but potential directions or unresolved questions.

---

## üí° Untriaged Ideas

* **Version Control for Docs**: Explore specific strategies or tools for versioning documentation content, especially when tightly coupled with code releases.
* **Automated Doc Generation**: Investigate tools/pipelines for generating documentation directly from code comments (e.g., JSDoc, Sphinx).
* **Multi-language Support**: Consider how to extend the framework for projects requiring documentation in multiple languages.
* **User Interface for Docs**: Research options for serving the Markdown documentation through a more interactive web UI (beyond just a static site generator).

---

## ‚ùì Open Questions / Deferred Decisions

* **Image Management Strategy**: Is `docs/img/` sufficient for all image needs, or might more granular sub-directories be required for complex projects?
* **External References**: How should the framework best handle links to external documentation or APIs to ensure they remain valid?
* **File Naming Conventions**: Are the current `project_*.md` names optimal for all possible project contexts, or should more flexible naming patterns be introduced or suggested? (e.g., `feature_name.md`)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Future Risks

* **Framework Drift**: Projects may customize the framework too much, leading to inconsistencies over time. How to enforce core framework adherence without stifling project-specific needs?
* **Tooling Changes**: Updates to critical tools (VS Code, Markdownlint, Prettier, Front Matter) might break existing workflows or require significant adaptation.
