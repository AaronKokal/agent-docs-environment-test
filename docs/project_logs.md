## Project Logs

This document tracks significant events, decisions, and progress points for this Documentation Framework Repository.

## 2025-08-25 - Initial Framework Setup & Iteration

* **Objective**: Establish a standardized documentation structure and associated guides.
* **Key Decisions**:
  * **Introduced `framework/` directory**: To separate fixed templates (like AGENT_README, DOCUMENT_EDITING_GUIDE, PROJECT_README) from project-specific living documents in `docs/`.
  * **Renamed `project_docs.md` to `DOCUMENT_EDITING_GUIDE.md`**: For clearer semantics and consistency.
  * **Standardized Frontmatter**: Ensured all framework Markdown files consistently use a defined frontmatter schema, including descriptions, non-draft status, and relevant tags/categories.
  * **Introduced `project_tasks.md`**: Dedicated file for project-specific to-do lists to differentiate from logs and considerations.
  * **Added `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`**: To assist agents in transitioning existing projects to this framework.
  * **Created `PROJECT_README.md`**: To serve as a template for new project READMEs, guiding the setup and use of the framework.
* **Problems Encountered**: Initial confusion regarding the ideal placement of core framework documents (resolved by creating `framework/`). Linting inconsistencies identified and resolved across multiple Markdown files.
* **Reasoning**: These changes aim to make the documentation framework more intuitive, robust, and easier for both human collaborators and AI agents to utilize effectively across many projects.

## ... (Future Log Entries)

* [New log entries will be added here as this framework evolves]
