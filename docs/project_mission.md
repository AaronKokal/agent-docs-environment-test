## Project Mission

**Goal:** To establish a standardized, consistent, and easily maintainable documentation framework for all projects. This framework aims to simplify documentation creation and ensure high quality across the board.

**Pain Points Addressed:**

* Inconsistent documentation styles and structures across projects.
* Difficulty for new contributors/agents to understand existing project documentation.
* Lack of clear guidelines for managing documentation over time.
* Redundancy and outdated information.

**Expected Outcomes:**

* All projects will have a uniform, clear, and up-to-date documentation set.
* AI agents will have precise instructions for creating and maintaining documentation.
* Human contributors will have clear guidelines for their documentation efforts.
* Reduced time and effort spent on documentation maintenance.
